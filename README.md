# Deploying-an-Django-application-in-AWS-
The main objective of this project is to build a full stack Django application and deployment of a scalable Django application based on the CPU usage the application could be auto scaled and provide high availability of computation. Application would be auto scaled by using threshold-based algorithm. We could observe and verify this by monitoring CPU utilization in parallel to running EC2 instances using Cloudwatch.
